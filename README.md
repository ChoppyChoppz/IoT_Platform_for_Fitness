# IoT_Platform_for_Fitness
An IoT project that aims to provide services for fitness management, weight loss and healthy lifestyle. Project carried out for the "Programming for IoT applications" course at the Politecnico di Torino, Italy.

The solution proposed aims to improve the lifestyle of athletes and people with weight and therefore health problems. It integrates different IoT devices to monitor a person's vital parameters in any kind of environment like gym or home. The overall platform provides unified interfaces (through both REST and MQTT) to integrate sensors to everyday life. Finally, the platform provides end-users with detailed knowledge of the calories and the weight trend. 

Summarizing, the main features it offers are:  
• remote control of health signals; 
• unified interfaces (i.e. REST Web Services and MQTT queues); 
• end-user applications for self-awareness, carried out via telegram bot

Two videos were made to sponsor the service and explain to the user how it works.
